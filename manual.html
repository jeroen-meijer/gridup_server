          >To begin, place the game board on the table. Each player selects a
          token. Then they place their token on the table near the space
          labelled Go, placing it on Go only when their first turn to move
          arrives. One player becomes the Banker, who distributes assets from
          the Bank to the players. Only the player in question can use their
          money, money can only be lent via the Banker or by the player money.
          Each player is given $1,500 in cash divided as follows: two each of
          $500s, $100&#39;s and $50&#39;s; six $20&#39;s, five each of
          $10&#39;s, $5&#39;s and $1&#39;s. All remaining cash and other
          equipment go to the Bank. The Banker may play too but must keep his
          personal funds from the bank. He/she also needs to make sure that they
          collect $200 when they pass GO.</span
